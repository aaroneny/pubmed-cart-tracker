### [Non-viral TcBuster transposon engineering of CD70-CAR natural killer cells for the treatment of osteosarcoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41537165/)
- 📚 **Molecular therapy. Oncology** | IF: N/A
- **摘要**: Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents, yet outcomes have remained largely unchanged for over 40 years. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell thera...

### [Novel syngeneic model of anti-mouse CLDN18.2 CAR -T therapy for gastric cancer demonstrates a synergy with TGF-β and PD-L1 inhibitors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41537163/)
- 📚 **Molecular therapy. Oncology** | IF: N/A
- **摘要**: There are very few syngeneic mouse cell line models available for gastric cancer owing to the rarity of stomach epithelium-specific promoter. Mouse cell line models are useful to study an immunologica...

### [A Murine Bispecific Antibody Efficiently Redirects T Cells Against Calr Mutated Stem Cells In Vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41532194/)
- 📚 **American journal of hematology** | 🌟 **IF: 12.8**
- **摘要**: Calreticulin (CALR) mutations are prevalent in 20%-30% of patients with BCR::ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Mutant calreticulin (mutCALR), presented by the thrombopoietin receptor (...

### [Single-Chain IL-23 Secretion by CAR T Cells Improves Tumor Control and Persistence Against Solid Tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520177/)
- 📚 **Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy** | IF: N/A
- **摘要**: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy achieves durable remissions in hematological malignancies, yet its success against solid tumors is blunted in part by the tumors' highly immunosuppressiv...

### [Clinical Trial Results Provide the Rationale to Protect Dual HIV-specific T Cells with a Signaling-Defective HIV Fusion Inhibitor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520175/)
- 📚 **Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy** | IF: N/A
- **摘要**: Coupling the HIV fusion inhibitor C34 with CXCR4 (C34-CXCR4) protected CD4 T cells from all strains of HIV. Escape from C34-CXCR4 expression proved difficult, requiring more than 21 serial passages, m...

### [Engineering single-vector logic-gated CAR T cells with transgene sizes beyond current limitations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41513407/)
- 📚 **Journal for immunotherapy of cancer** | 🌟 **IF: 10.9**
- **摘要**: Engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with logic-gated synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor circuits can enhance specificity and mitigate on-target/off-tumor toxicity. However, the conven...

### [PD-1 suppresses CAR signaling by forming the inhibitory signalosome colocalizing to CAR microclusters.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41507351/)
- 📚 **Communications biology** | IF: N/A
- **摘要**: The combination of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using anti-PD-1 has been demonstrated to enhance antitumor CAR-T cell responses. Although, in co...

### [HVEM costimulatory domain boosts CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors via enhanced TRAF-mediated TNF signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41501787/)
- 📚 **Cell communication and signaling : CCS** | IF: N/A
- **摘要**: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown success in hematological malignancies, but its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited. Herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a co-stimulato...
