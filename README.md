### [Advancing adoptive T cell therapy in ovarian cancer: barriers, innovations, and emerging platforms.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41513408/)
- **PMID**: 41513408
- **摘要预览**: Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has demonstrated curative potential in select cancers, but its translation to solid tumors such as ovarian cancer (OC) has been hindered by multiple factors, including tumo...

### [Engineering single-vector logic-gated CAR T cells with transgene sizes beyond current limitations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41513407/)
- **PMID**: 41513407
- **摘要预览**: Engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with logic-gated synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptor circuits can enhance specificity and mitigate on-target/off-tumor toxicity. However, the conven...

### [PD-1 suppresses CAR signaling by forming the inhibitory signalosome colocalizing to CAR microclusters.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41507351/)
- **PMID**: 41507351
- **摘要预览**: The combination of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using anti-PD-1 has been demonstrated to enhance antitumor CAR-T cell responses. Although, in co...

### [HVEM costimulatory domain boosts CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors via enhanced TRAF-mediated TNF signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41501787/)
- **PMID**: 41501787
- **摘要预览**: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown success in hematological malignancies, but its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited. Herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a co-stimulato...

### [Engineered outer membrane vesicles enhance solid tumour CAR-T cell therapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41501251/)
- **PMID**: 41501251
- **摘要预览**: Major challenges facing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for solid tumours include the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment and the heterogeneity of antigen expression. Bacterial ou...
